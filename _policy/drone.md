# FIT Drone Policy

## Purpose of policy

The purpose of this policy is to provide direction and detail how Drones may be used at FIT events.

## Policy scope and application

This policy automatically applies to all Tier 1 & 2 events as identified by the [FIT Event
Classification Policy], including:

-   Touch World Cup
-   Youth Touch World Cup
-   Regional International competitions

Tier 3 event organisers are encouraged to adopt this policy.

To ensure appropriate rules and legal requirements are applied to Drone usage (commercial and
private) at FIT sanctioned events the following policy will be trialed over a two (2) year period
with ongoing review to ensure safety is the primary consideration.

## Definitions

Authorised Party
:   means a drone operator that holds the appropriate and relevant civil aviation authority and a
    Remote Operating Certificate, or the relevant national equivalent. The Authorised Party must
    hold appropriate insurance coverage, including but not limited to, Public Liability insurance.

Drone
:   means a remotely piloted aircraft. Also known as an **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle** or UAV and
    **Remotely Piloted Aircraft** or RPA.

## Regulatory background

Commercial entities found to be operating a Drone without appropriate approvals from regulators may
be served with infringement notices and/or financial penalties and/or criminal charges.

Strict rules in relation to civil/hobby Drone use may also apply. Failure to comply may be a breach
of federal regulations and may result in infringement notices and/or financial penalties and/or
criminal charges.

## Policy statement

FIT recognises there are various beneficial applications of Drone technology at FIT events.

To reduce risk FIT will partner with licensed pilots to oversee all Drone flights at FIT events.

FIT will share key learnings with member nations regarding the adoption of Drone use during events
to ensure a global best practice standard may be established.

## FIT Drone policy

### Drone usage

Not all FIT events will permit the use of Drones. The event specific conditions will identify the
degree to which Drones may be used.

When a FIT event permits the use of Drones, the following steps must be taken to ensure local
regulations are met:

-   The event management team must engage with an Authorised Party to ensure compliance with
    aviation laws and develop an implementation plan for the safe use of Drones that will protect
    players, officials, spectators and the general public.
-   The Authorised Party must be appointed by FIT no less than three (3) months prior to the event
    to ensure adequate steps and processes are in place for training, accessibility and safety.
-   The Authorised Party must ensure a full operational outline including safety briefing, job
    safety assessment, risk matrix, specific locations of approved operations at venues, Drone
    insurance, public liability, and where appropriate, training, are evident prior to any
    engagement of Drone use.

Aviation regulations vary between jurisdictions. The event management team must work with the
appointed Authorised Party to ensure compliance for the particular venue.

### Pilot induction

When a FIT event permits the use of Drones the Authorised Party will conduct a pilot induction
session prior to the start of the event. Only individuals who successfully complete the induction
will be permitted to pilot Drones during the event.

### Non-compliance

FIT, the event management team and the Authorised Party will work collaboratively to ensure any
non-compliant flights are reported to the local aviation authorities who may investigate.

### Unauthorised flights

In the event of an unauthorised flight by an individual from a FIT member nation, the member nation
will be served with a fine notice of AUD$2,000 and all representative teams of the member nation
will be suspended from taking further part in the event (matches will be awarded to opponents as
forfeiture) until the fine has been paid.

### Policy review

Due the rising adoption and changing nature of Drone use and their regulations across the world,
FIT will review this policy on an on-going basis.

## Contact

Enquiries in relation to this policy should be directed to the [FIT Event Commission Chair].

FIT and our aviation partners can work with member nations who wish to establish their own Drone
policies.
